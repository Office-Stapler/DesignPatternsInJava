The Decorator pattern is a structural pattern lets you attach new behaviours
to objects by wrapping them around wrapper objects. \
In this example, we will be using coffee, where the coffee can have
cream or chocolate as added toppings. The coffee is then "decorated" with
the decorator classes which holds the coffee itself.
