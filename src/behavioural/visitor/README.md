The Visitor pattern is a pattern which allows new behaviours to be added to a
class without the need to modify the original object. \
This example takes a car as the visitable and uses two visitors, the 
brandvisitor which just prints the brand of the class, and the cost
multiplier visitor, which just prints out a cost multiplier for the type
of car.
