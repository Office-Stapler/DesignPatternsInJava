The Template pattern is a pattern which splits up specific parts of a class into
many methods which would be the same throughout all subclasses and defaults them
into one template clas. This allows for reduced repeatability. \
This example will use a PortableConsole template where the steps to play
a game, is the same for all portable consoles.
