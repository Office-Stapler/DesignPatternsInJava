The Observer pattern is a pattern that lets you notify multiple objects when any
events that occur. \
This example uses a weather station which is the observervable / subject, while the
displays act as the observers to observe the different aspects of the weather station
such as:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
