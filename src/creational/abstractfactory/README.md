Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that allows for the production
of related objects without specifying the actual class. \

In this example, we have an electronic factory which produces laptops, phones
and tablets. The actual implementation of these factories are determined
under the "AppleFactory" and "SamsungFactory" which produce differnt types
of phones, tablets or laptops.
