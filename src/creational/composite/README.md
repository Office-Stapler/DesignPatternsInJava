The Composite pattern is a structural pattern that componse objects into
a tree structure where you can treat each of these objects as individual. \
In this example, directories and files can be used to demonstrate the structure
of the composite pattern. Directories act as the regular component, while
the files act as the leaf nodes for the tree structure.
